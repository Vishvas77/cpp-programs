\## 📂 Program List

The repository includes programs covering the following topics:



\- Basic input and output operations  

\- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch`)  

\- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  

\- Functions and modular programming  

\- Mathematical and logical problem solving  



Each `.cpp` file is an independent program.
